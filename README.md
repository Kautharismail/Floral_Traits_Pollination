# Floral_Traits_Pollination
Looking at how several floral traits influence attractiveness to pollinators : honeybees and bumblebees
The data was obtained from the open source library,DOAJ.In a Journal of Pollination Ecology using a CC BY licence , Journal volume & issue                        Vol. 37 , DOI:https://doi.org/10.26786/1920-7603(2025)813
This study was investigating how 119 cultivators of 8 different plant genera namely :Salvia nemorosa(SV), Gaillardia aristata(GA), Delosperma cooperi(DL),Lavandula angustifolia(LF), Lavandula stoechas(LV), Sedum telephium(SE), Perovskia atriplicifolia(PV) and Agastache hybrida(MP),  with their combination of corrolla tube depth , flower colour, nectar sugar content, UV presence and the number of flowers affected attractiveness to bumblebees and honeybees.This study found that cultivars of the same species differed in attractiveness to both bumblebees and honeybees with colour, nectar sugar content and corolla depth being important factors.
